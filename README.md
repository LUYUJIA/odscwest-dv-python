# Data Visualization: From Python to Dashboards

Data visualization is fundamental to the data science process.  Using plots and graphs to convey a complex idea makes your data more accessible to everyone.  In this session, you will learn the fundamentals of plotting with Pandas in Jupyter by building an interactive visualization prototype that can also run as a standalone web application/dashboard.  This session is for anyone who wants to be more familiar with data visualization, hands-on, with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, interactive widgets, and Flask.

At the end of this session, attendees will:

## Part 1
- Be familiar with everyday notebook and data visualization conventions 
- Be able to describe the integration between matplotlib is integrated with Pandas
- Understand the concept of "figure" and "axes." 
- Implement standard plots using Pandas

## Part 2
- Understand the Juptyer plugin system
- Install and configure "widgets."
- Implement a basic prototype visualization for exploring data with interactive elements
- Be familiar with other visual frameworks and assess their strengths 

## Part 3
- Understand the tradeoffs between sharing notebooks vs. custom dashboards
- Be able to identify the anatomy of a Flask web application
- Implement a prototype visualization from Jupyter, in Flask

## Environment Setup

This session is hands-on and interactive.  To get the most out of this session, attendees should dedicate some time before the event to ensure their Python environments' have the proper configuration.  We will mainly be using Jupyter Lab and Python libraries.

### General Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.8.x
- A dedicated code editor such as Visual Studio, PyCharm, or Sublime

### For Windows Users
Gitbash - https://gitforwindows.org/

### Python Libraries
- Panel
- Flask
- Jupyter Lab
- Pandas

Once we receive more feedback on the abstract and content for this session, I will finalize these prerequisites and provide a notebook that attendees and run to check the prerequisite libraries and provide a guide for installing the Python environment.

### Optional
For those having problems with library installs, a custom Docker container is available (TBD).  For instructions on installing Docker, please follow the official guide:
